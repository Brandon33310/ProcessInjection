# Process Injection Series

This repository contains code examples and demonstrations from my series on process injection techniques in Linux. Each example illustrates a different method of injecting code or data into a running process, starting with the basics and progressing to more advanced techniques.

## Contents

### 1. Blog 1: Basic Process Injection
- **Folder:** `injector`
- **Description:** A simple example of process injection using the `ptrace` system call to inject a message into a running process. This example is covered in detail in the first blog post of the series.
